    <h2>Hi i am saifuddin</h2>
    <p>Recent research has provided a wealth of insight about how dogs came to be domesticated by humans 
        and the roles they played in Native American culture. DNA studies on archaeological finds suggest 
        that dogs may have been domesticated by humans as long as 40,000 years ago. When the first humans 
        came to North America from Eurasia, at least 12,000 years ago, domesticated dogs came with them. 
        They appear to have been highly prized by early North American hunter-gatherers and were their only 
        animal companions for centuries, since there were no horses on the continent until the 16th century.
